        <h2>Intelligent Wearables for Pedestrian Safety</h2>
        <div class="content-info">
            <p>
                We have become engrossed in our personal smartphones and other devices in today's
                society, even during instances that place our lives at risk. We design a low-power wearable
                headset mounted with an array of MEMS microphones to detect and localize oncoming
                cars to be worn by pedestrians engaged in music or talking on the phone while on
                the streets. The headset extracts and transmits audio features to the smartphone,
                which detects and localizes oncoming cars using novel machine learning and signal processing
                techniques. Our wearable platform provides pedestrians with a second set of ears
                to detect life-threatening situations in urban environments when their own ears
                are preoccupied.
