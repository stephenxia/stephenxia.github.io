I am an assistant professor in the Department of [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/electrical-computer/) and [Computer Science](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/computer-science/) (by courtesy) at [Northwestern University](https://www.northwestern.edu/), where I direct the [**Intelligent Mobile and Embedded Computing (IMEC) Lab**](https://imec-nu.github.io/). We work on a variety of exciting problems in embedded AI, mobile and embedded systems, and smart health.

Our goal is to realize truly intelligent, health-aware, and safer environments by embedding intelligent perception and reasoning into common objects and devices found all around us and utilizing them in efficient ways to provide useful services and improve quality of life. Our work spans a number of domains, including cyber-physical systems, edge computing, signal processing, machine learning, data science, wearables, robotics, health, etc.

<!--**News: I am looking for motivated Ph.D. students beginning in 2024. If you're interested, please send me an email ([stephen.xia@northwestern.edu](mailto:stephen.xia@northwestern.edu)) with your CV, and I'd be happy to chat! I am also always on the lookout for motivated undergraduate and graduate students to work with; please reach out with your CV if interested.**-->


Prior to Northwestern, I was a postdoctoral scholar in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences at UC Berkeley (2023). I received the Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from Columbia University (2022) and the B.S. in Electrical Engineering from Rice University (2016).

**Please visit the [IMEC Lab's website](https://imec-nu.github.io/) for updated information on my news, publications, projects, and students.**
