I am a Postdoctoral Scholar in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences at UC Berkeley supervised by Dr. [Prabal Dutta](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Faculty/Homepages/prabal.html) and Dr. [Xiaofan Jiang](http://fredjiang.com). I received the Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from Columbia University (2022), and the B.S. in Electrical Engineering from Rice University (2016).

My vision is to realize truly intelligent, health-aware, and safer environments by embedding intelligence into common objects and devices found all around us. I develop techniques and systems that jointly leverage signal processing and established physical models to guide the development and training of data-driven machine learning methods to yield solutions, services, and applications that are robust, yet capable of running continuously and in real-time, on resource-constrained platforms. My research bridges the gap between systems, signal processing, and machine learning, as well as contributes to areas in embedded systems, mobile edge computing, Internet-of-Things, artificial intelligence, data science, and digital health.
